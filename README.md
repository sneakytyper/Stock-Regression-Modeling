# Stock Regression Modeling  
*A quantitative analysis of stock market predictions using linear regression techniques (OLS, Lasso, Ridge, Elastic Net) with error metric evaluation (RSE, MSE, RMSE).*  

---

## 📌 Overview  
This project explores the application of **linear regression models** for stock market prediction and risk assessment. The following regression techniques were implemented and evaluated:  
- **Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Regression**  
- **Lasso Regression (L1 Regularization)**  
- **Ridge Regression (L2 Regularization)**  
- **Elastic Net Regression (L1 + L2)**  

Key performance metrics such as **Residual Standard Error (RSE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)** were calculated to compare model effectiveness.

## 📊 Features  
✅ **Multiple Regression Models** – OLS, Lasso, Ridge, Elastic Net  
✅ **Error Metric Analysis** – RSE, MSE, RMSE for model comparison  
✅ **Stock Data Processing** – Cleaning, normalization, feature engineering  
✅ **Visualizations** – Residual plots, coefficient comparisons, prediction vs actual trends
